<p slot="bio">
Rodrigo Constanzo makes art and thinks that itâ€™s an important thing to do. The art he makes is generally smeared in time, in the form of music. He improvises and acts ad the antennae to the beauty, electricity, and endless surprise that is living a crazy life. He composes and tries to create new sounds, interactions, and behaviours that he finds interesting and challenging.
