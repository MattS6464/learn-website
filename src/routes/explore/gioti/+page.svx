## Overview

In episode twelve of the FluCoMa Podcast I talk with Dr. Artemi-Maria Gioti, a composer, researcher, and creative coder who specialises in the creative uses of artificial intelligence and machine learning. We learn about the workings of two of her pieces that make use of these technologies, and how Artemi incorporates computational techniques into her creative practice.
