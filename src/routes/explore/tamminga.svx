His work sounds regularly in different settings all over the globe: in concert halls and venues (Madrid, Amsterdam, Berlin, Istanbul, Venice), festivals (Huddersfield, Murcia, ZÃ¼rich, Stavanger), churches (Mechelen, Utrecht, Antwerp), on the streets, in factories (Goes, Twente) and from towers (New York, Kaunas, Almere).

## Overview

In this first episode of the FluCoMa podcast I talk to Dr. Freida Abtan. We talk about some of the projects she has worked on, and her approach to creative programming in general. She discusses how *computational* approaches can be found at the heart of her *artistic* practice, and what the concept of *reactive audio design* means for her. As well as being an artist, Freida is also an educator, and we discuss her ideas around the teaching, dissemination and learning of technologies such as those found in the FluCoMa tools.
