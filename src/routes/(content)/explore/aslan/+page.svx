## Overview

In the thirteenth episode of the FluCoMa Podcast, I talk with Dr. Jess Aslan who is a performer, composer and educator currently based at Goldsmiths. We talk about her creative process and her approaches to using machine listening in her work, instrument design and algorithmic composition. We also discuss the role collaboration plays in her practice, and her ideas around presence of technology and computers in musicking.
