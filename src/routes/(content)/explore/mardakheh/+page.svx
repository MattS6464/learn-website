## Overview

In Episode 18 of the FluCoMa Podcast, we talk with composer, sound-artist, programmer, and researcher Milad Mardakheh. After learning about Miladâ€™s creative process, we delve into an important topic and approach in his work: data sonification. We observe the forms this concepts takes across many of his works, and take a look at some pieces that make use of the FluCoMa tools.
